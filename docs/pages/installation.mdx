# Installation

Just run the following code.

```bash copy filename="Terminal" /juxtapose/
pip install juxtapose
```

System Requirements:

- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/) or later.
- [mmcv 2.0.0](https://mmcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/installation.html#install-with-pip) or later. (See [guide below](#step-1-install-mmcv) to install)
- macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.

> **Good to know (Optional)**:
>
> - You can install in the root pythonpath, OR
> - You can setup a brand new conda environment if you have installed [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) by running `conda create -n <name> python=3.9`.
> - After you have successfully create the conda environment, you can run `conda activate <name>` to activate the environment.
> - Then, you can follow the steps below.

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Install `juxtapose`

```bash copy filename="Terminal" /juxtapose/
pip install juxtapose
```

### Step 2: Test If The Installation Works

Create a python script, make sure you are in the environment that you've installed `juxtapose`.

```python copy filename="test.py" showLineNumbers {1,4-8,11-15}
from juxtapose import RTM

# you can view type hinting for each argument
model = RTM(
  det="rtmdet-s",
  tracker="bytetrack",
  pose="rtmpose-l"
)

# run inference
model(
  source="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ziqinyeow/juxtapose-sdk/main/asset/football.jpeg",
  show=True, # this will create an cv2 window to show the inference result
  save=True # this will save a copy of inference images/videos and its keypoints in csv format
)

```

Then run the following:

```python copy filename="Terminal"
python test.py
```

If you faced any errors, please kindly refer to the [potential errors](#potential-errors) section below or create an issue [here](https://github.com/ziqinyeow/juxtapose/issues/new/choose).

## Potential Errors

### `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'`

This error is raised when installing `juxtapose` library with a brand new environment,
because [`xtcocotools`](https://github.com/jin-s13/xtcocoapi) which required by [`mmpose`](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose)
in `juxtapose` expects us to have `numpy` and `matplotlib` pre-installed. This is often occur in macOs (Apple Silicon) environment.
You can solve it elegantly by running:

```bash copy filename="Terminal"
pip install numpy matplotlib

# then only run
pip install juxtapose
```

### `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mmcv._ext'`

This error is raised when running the `RTM()` function to load the `rtmdet` or `rtmpose` model. This is often caused by the
installation issue of `mmcv`. You can solve it elegantly by running:

<Tabs items={['Windows', 'macOS', 'Linux']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy filename="Terminal"
    pip uninstall mmcv

    # reinstall back mmcv
    pip install mmcv==2.1.0 -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cu118/torch2.0/index.html
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy filename="Terminal"
    pip uninstall mmcv

    # reinstall back mmcv
    pip install mmcv==2.1.0 -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cpu/torch2.0/index.html
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy filename="Terminal"
    pip uninstall mmcv

    # reinstall back mmcv
    pip install mmcv==2.1.0 -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cu118/torch2.0/index.html
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### `ImportError: DLL load failed`

This error is raised when you installed an uncompatible version of `torch`. It is often occur when you installed a GPU version of PyTorch
in a non-GPU environment. This error can be elegantly solved by running:

<Tabs items={['Windows', 'macOS', 'Linux']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy filename="Terminal"
    pip uninstall torch

    # reinstall back torch
    pip install torch==2.0.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 # gpu
    # pip install torch==2.0.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 # cpu only
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy filename="Terminal"
    pip uninstall torch

    # reinstall back torch
    pip install torch==2.0.1
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy filename="Terminal"
    pip uninstall torch

    # reinstall back torch
    pip install torch==2.0.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 # gpu
    # pip install torch==2.0.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu # cpu only
    ```
